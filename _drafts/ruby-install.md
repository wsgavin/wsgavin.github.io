Setting up a [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) environment has been made easy with [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv). While easy, there is still set up that requires some thought. This project has captured my thoughts (in a script) on how I like to set up `rbenv`, Ruby, and my environment.

I do not code much at all in ruby but I find a lot of projects use ruby as a base. For example, Jekyll (which I use to build this site) leverages Ruby. Because of this keeping a clean and consistent environment is helpful.
